# Team User Edit Permissions Removal - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed edit permissions for team users on both Invoices and Payments pages, ensuring they can only view and create but not edit or delete these records.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Permission Updates

#### User Model (`server/models/User.js`)
- **Removed from team user permissions:**
  - `billing.edit` - Team users can no longer edit invoices
  - `invoices.edit` - Team users can no longer edit invoices
  - `payments.edit` - Team users can no longer edit payments

- **Updated team user permissions to:**
  ```javascript
  [
    'products.view',
    'billing.view', 'billing.create',        // Can view and create invoices
    'transfers.view', 'transfers.create',
    'payments.view', 'payments.create',     // Can view and create payments
    'invoices.view', 'invoices.create',     // Can view and create invoices
    'reports.view',
    'branches.view',                        // Needed for transfers
    'dashboard.view'
  ]
  ```

#### Seed Database (`server/seed-database.js`)
- Updated all team users (team1, team2, team3, team4) to remove edit permissions
- Re-seeded database with updated permissions

### 2. Frontend Permission Checks

#### Invoices Page (`client/src/pages/InvoicesPage.tsx`)
- Added permission checks for edit and delete buttons
- **Edit button:** Only shows if user has `invoices.edit` permission
- **Delete button:** Only shows if user has `invoices.delete` permission
- Team users will not see these buttons

#### Payments Page (`client/src/pages/PaymentsPage.tsx`)
- Added permission checks for edit and delete buttons
- **Edit button:** Only shows if user has `payments.edit` permission
- **Delete button:** Only shows if user has `payments.delete` permission
- **Payment Details Modal:** Edit button in modal also respects permissions
- Team users will not see these buttons

### 3. Permission Implementation Details

```typescript
// Permission checks in both pages
const canEditInvoice = hasPermission(user, PERMISSIONS.INVOICES_EDIT);
const canDeleteInvoice = hasPermission(user, PERMISSIONS.INVOICES_DELETE);
const canEditPayment = hasPermission(user, PERMISSIONS.PAYMENTS_EDIT);
const canDeletePayment = hasPermission(user, PERMISSIONS.PAYMENTS_DELETE);

// Conditional rendering
{canEditInvoice && (
  <Button>Edit</Button>
)}
{canDeleteInvoice && (
  <Button>Delete</Button>
)}
```

## Current Team User Capabilities

### ✅ What Team Users CAN Do:
- **View** invoices and payments
- **Create** new invoices and payments
- **View** products (but not individual product details)
- **Transfer** products between branches
- **View** branches (needed for transfers)
- **View** dashboard and reports

### ❌ What Team Users CANNOT Do:
- **Edit** invoices or payments
- **Delete** invoices or payments
- **Add, Edit, or Delete** products
- **View** individual product details
- **Manage** users or branches
- **Edit** or **Delete** transfers

## Admin User Capabilities

### ✅ What Admin Users CAN Do:
- **All** operations on all entities
- **Full CRUD** access to products, invoices, payments, transfers
- **Manage** users and branches
- **View** individual product details
- **Access** all system features

## Testing Results

### Backend API Testing
- ✅ Team users can view invoices and payments
- ✅ Team users can create invoices and payments
- ✅ Team users are blocked from editing invoices and payments
- ✅ Admin users retain full access

### Frontend UI Testing
- ✅ Edit buttons hidden for team users on Invoices page
- ✅ Delete buttons hidden for team users on Invoices page
- ✅ Edit buttons hidden for team users on Payments page
- ✅ Delete buttons hidden for team users on Payments page
- ✅ Edit button hidden in Payment Details Modal for team users
- ✅ Frontend build successful with no errors

## Database Verification

### Updated User Permissions
```json
{
  "email": "team1@company.com",
  "role": "team",
  "permissions": [
    "products.view",
    "billing.view", "billing.create",
    "transfers.view", "transfers.create",
    "payments.view", "payments.create",
    "invoices.view", "invoices.create",
    "reports.view",
    "branches.view",
    "dashboard.view"
  ]
}
```

## Summary

The implementation successfully restricts team users from editing invoices and payments while maintaining their ability to view and create these records. The frontend UI dynamically hides edit and delete buttons based on user permissions, providing a clean and intuitive user experience.

**Key Benefits:**
- Enhanced security through granular permission control
- Clear separation of responsibilities between team and admin users
- Maintained functionality for essential team operations
- Clean UI that adapts to user permissions

**Files Modified:**
- `server/models/User.js` - Updated default permissions
- `server/seed-database.js` - Updated seed data
- `client/src/pages/InvoicesPage.tsx` - Added permission checks
- `client/src/pages/PaymentsPage.tsx` - Added permission checks

The system now properly enforces the business rule that team users can only view and create invoices/payments but cannot modify existing records.
